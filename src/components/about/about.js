        I'm a full stack software developer based out of London, England and an
        xpat of New Zealand. I enjoy software development for its sometimes mind
        bending mix of subjectiveness and objectivness where there is almost
        never a sliver bullet. This has helped me develop extensive software
        skill over 6 years of programming and 3 years of working in high
        performing agile teams.

        Outside of programming my interests include writing, journalism, hiking
        throughout the world, exploring Londons historic pubs, running, reading
        books relating to topics such as sociology, fantasy, politics,
        philosophy and...sensory deprivation tanks ;)

        I'm a 24 year old full stack software developer based out of Auckland,
        New Zealand. I currently have 2 years of full stack software development
        experience within the fintech, aml domain which I attained at AplyId. I
        gathered this experience after earning a bachelor of engineering in
        software engineering with first class honours and a variety of
        internships at companies such as banks, failed start ups and successful
        start ups.

        You may be wondering, why am I in the technology space? For me
        technology has acted as a frame through which I live life. It was never
        a question of "if" I went into the technology industry it was always a
        question of "what" area of technology I went into. I enjoy software
        development for its sometimes annoying mix of subjectiveness and
        objectivness, there isn't always a single right way, there is definitely
        a wrong way and certainly nicer ways. Figuring out for myself and
        exploring how others define good code and how to write good code is what
        I find enjoyable about software development.

        Outside of work my technology interests include functional programming,
        web3, blockchain and smart contract development i.e. Crypto. Outside of
        software my interests include hiking throughout the New Zealand native
        bush, reading various books relating to topics such as sociology,
        politics, fantasy and philosophy, trying our American and New Zealand
        craft beers and...sensory deprivation tanks ;)
