    <p className="about__description">
      I'm a 24 year old software engineer based in Auckland New Zealand. Since I
      was a young lad playing pokemon on gameboy advanced and GTA on PSP I have
      been deeply interested in technology, electronics and software. I used to
      tear apart these (now crude) gaming consoles or phones and attempt to put
      them back together often with little success. This interest developed into
      me taking digital technologies at my highschool (Westlake boys for the
      alumni) where most of my highschool time was absorbed along with an
      interest in calculus and economics. To me software was an obvious career
      choice, one that fit like a glove and one that I did not hesitate to make.
      I then chose to head to the university with the strongest software school
      and the one which would give me the most opportunites to grow my interest
      in software. This choice culminated in me heading to the Victoria
      University of Wellington (VUW) (Now The university of Wellington) which
      allows students to specialise in software development from year 1 and had
      a world recognised artifical intelligence school which receives money from
      the likes of Huawei to perform facial recognition research. At VUW I
      decided to take a 4 year engineering degree majoring in software.
