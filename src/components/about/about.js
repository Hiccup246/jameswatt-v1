      <p>
        I'm a software engineer based out of London, England and an xpat of New
        Zealand. I enjoy software engineering for its sometimes mind bending mix
        of subjectiveness and objectivness where there is almost never a sliver
        bullet. This has helped me develop extensive software skill over 6 years
        of programming and 3 years of working in high performing agile teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software my interests include writing, journalism, hiking
        throughout the world, exploring Londons historic pubs, running, reading
        books relating to topics such as sociology, fantasy, politics,
        philosophy and...sensory deprivation tanks ;)
