# James Watt Personal Website
This github repo represents the personal website for London based software engineer James Watt. The website was desgined in Figma and created in Gastby under the limitations that no css frameworks be used and that as few libraries as possible be used to promote the creation of components from scratch for learning purposes.

## TODO
- Fix contrast colour issues (1/2 Completed)
- Make components more 'React' like. For example, reducing React Ref usage and replacing it with components or state.
